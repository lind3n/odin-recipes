    <h2>Description</h2>
    Chicken Parm, is a casserole-type dish with chicken in a cheesy marinara sauce.
    It is one of Mari's favorites.
    Making your own breaded and air-fried chicken is the most annoying part of the recipe. If you want 
    a crispy texture you can prepare them as individual fried chicken pieces with a smaller amount of sauce
    and cheese on top on a baking sheet, or you can do the more traditional method and have chicken submerged 
    in sauce and cheese in a baking dish.  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 chicken breasts, tenderized with a mallet</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cups? of mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs, italian seasoned is best</li>
        <li>2 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>salt, to taste, for chicken</li>
        <li>ground pepper, to taste, for chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of flour</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre heat oven to 425F</li>
        <li>Put the flour in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Put the eggs in a seperate small bowl</li>
        <li>Put panko breadcrumbs in a third small bowl, optionally add a pinch of seasonings like paprika, oregano, chili powder.</li>
        <li>Put each chicken breast in the flour bowl and coat it with flour, the dunk in the egg bowl, then dunk in the breadcrumb bowl until covered</li>
        <li>Air fry the breaded chicken breasts at 400F for 5-8 minutes, they dont have to be cooked through just to have the outsides crisped and dry</li>
        <li>Put a light layer of mozarella cheese and parmesan cheese at the base of a 9x9 baking dish</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breasts </li>
        <li>Put some parmesan cheese on top of each chicken breast, followed by a generous coating of marinara sauce, followed by covering with mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>Bake at 425F for 15-20 minutes, until a good amount of the cheese topping is starting to crisp up and darken</li>
        <li>Optionally, after air frying the chicken breasts you can spread them out on a baking tray, cover in parmesan, spoon marinara sauce on top almost to the edges, and then
            cover with mozarella and bake at 430 for 15-20min. Recipes online say this makes for crispier chicken but I like the heartiness of the casserole-type dish.
