    <h2>Description</h2>
    These crispy puff pastry salmon bites are a great dinner idea and re-heat amazingly well.
    I usually make them with a spinach cream cheese filling in addition to the salmon, but 
    they are also excellent with just the salmon, a lemon wedge and a caper or two.  I prefer to make
    the salmon pastries as small "bite size" squares, but I have done empanada-size versions in the past and
    other recipes call for one large salmon wellington-style pastry. This recipe is adapted from a tasty.co
    recipe for the filling, and my mom's own home cooked bite size pastries. 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>filet of salmon, sliced into 1"-2" squares </li>
        <li>2 boxes of puff pastry (2 sheest per) per large salmon filet</li>
        <li> capers</li>
        <li> 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped</li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 small lemons, sliced into circles and then small wedges without rind</li>
        <li>1/2 box (4oz) of cream cheese</li>
        <li> 1/2 onion, diced</li>
        <li>5oz spinach</li>
        <li> 2-3 Eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>

        <li>ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>less than 1/2 cup of flour</li>

        <li>Add just enough filling to cover the top of each samon square</li>

    </ol>
