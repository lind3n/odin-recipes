    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is Mari's favorite dish and one of the first ones she made for me. It is a creamy sauce with a lemony tang with shrimp and pasta.
    It's simply amazing. 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of shrimp, size to preference</li>
        <li>1 lb pasta (I prefer linguini)</li>
        <li>2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of olive oil, approximate for cooking</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream </li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil, add a dash of salt, and add pasta</li>
        <li>Cook pasta to desired texture, drain, and set aside</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of olive oil to a saucepan on high heat and add shrimp when it is hot enough that they sizzle</li>
        <li>Add garlic, salt, and pepper to shrimp</li>
        <li>Cook shrimp on one side until the spines start to whiten and then flip</li>
        <li>Continue cooking shrimp until they have changed color throughout and there is no more translucent parts on the spine</li>
        <li>Take the shrimp out of the pan and set aside</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add approx 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream, just enough so that the bottom of the pan is completely covered</li>
        <li>Heat it on medium-high heat until it just begins to bubble</li>
        <li>Add the shredded parmesan cheese and continue cooking until it melts</li>
        <li>Add butter, juice of the 2 lemons, and salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Add pasta, mix, and add shrimp. Take off heat</li>
        
    </ol>
